    <u><h2>Overview</h2></u>

    <p>Hello there! This page holds a compiled version of all my notes that I have taken over the course of 5 weeks.</p>
    <p>Here is my compiled notes of what I have learned so far. Note that not everything is covered, however I have written what I thought is important. I will try to update regularly as I finish compiling my notes.</p>
    
    <u><h2>Week 1: Basic DC Theory</h2></u>
    <p>This chapter marks the first step in my electronics deep-dive, starting from first principles and building up to practical applications. Drawing from <em>The Art of Electronics</em> Ch.1–2 and <em>All About Circuits: Volume 1</em>, I explored current, voltage, and resistance through theory and playing around with small circuits.</p>

    <h3>Topics Covered</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ohm’s Law and practical measurements</li>
      <li>Resistors in series and parallel</li>
      <li>Voltage dividers and load effects</li>
      <li>Kirchhoff’s Current and Voltage Laws</li>
      <li>Nodal and Mesh Analysis</li>
      <li>Instrumentation limitations (multimeters, oscilloscopes)</li>
      <li>Thévenin and Norton Equivalent Circuits</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each concept includes both theoretical exposition and hands-on notes from breadboarding experiments and circuit simulations. These fundamentals laid the groundwork for future analysis techniques and embedded circuit design.</p>

    <u><h2>Week 2: Intro to E&M + Solenoids</h2></u>

    <p>This week initiates the transition from electric fields to magnetic fields and explores their intrinsic connection through the framework of classical electromagnetism. Topics include Biot–Savart Law, magnetic field generation, and solenoids.</p>

    <h2>Topics Covered</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Magnetic field lines and vector fields</li>
      <li>Right-hand rule and field direction</li>
      <li>Biot–Savart Law and current loops</li>
      <li>Field inside and outside solenoids</li>
      <li>Ampère’s Law (integral form)</li>
      <li>Solenoid construction and field uniformity</li>
      <li>Applications: inductors, relays, sensors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Python simulation was also developed to visualize solenoid behaviour.</p>
