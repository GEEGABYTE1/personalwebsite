    <h2>9. Comparison: Ideal vs. Real Solenoids</h2>
    <p>While the equation <strong>B = μ₀ n I</strong> describes an ideal infinite solenoid, real solenoids are finite in length and have spacing between windings. These deviations produce two primary effects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Edge Effects:</strong> At the ends of the solenoid, field lines bow outward and the field is less uniform</li>
      <li><strong>Radial Field Leakage:</strong> Magnetic flux can escape sideways between windings when tightly packed insulation is not used</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To account for these, numerical field integration (via Biot–Savart or finite element methods) is often used to model the full field profile.</p>

    <h2>10. Energy Stored in Magnetic Fields</h2>
    <p>The energy stored in a magnetic field is given by:</p>
    <pre>U = (1/2) L I²</pre>
    <p>Where <strong>L</strong> is the inductance and <strong>I</strong> is the current. In the case of a solenoid, the inductance can be approximated by:</p>
    <pre>L = (μ₀ n² A l)</pre>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>n</strong> is the number of turns per unit length</li>
      <li><strong>A</strong> is the cross-sectional area of the solenoid</li>
      <li><strong>l</strong> is the length of the coil</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This expression shows that solenoids are energy storage devices, storing energy in their magnetic field. This is the principle behind inductors, transformers, and magnetic field coils in electric vehicles and MRI machines.</p>

    <h2>11. Mathematical Derivation: Field at Center of Finite Solenoid</h2>
    <p>For a solenoid of finite length L and radius R, the on-axis magnetic field at the center (z = 0) is given by:</p>
    <pre>B = (μ₀ n I / 2) [cos(θ₁) - cos(θ₂)]</pre>
    <p>Where θ₁ and θ₂ are the angles subtended from the center to the two ends of the coil. For a symmetric coil, this simplifies to:</p>
    <pre>B = μ₀ n I (L / √(L² + 4R²))</pre>
    <p>As L → ∞, the expression converges to the ideal solenoid case. This provides a practical tool to estimate deviations from ideal behavior in real systems.</p>

    <h2>12. Safety and Practical Construction Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When constructing solenoids with significant current, ensure thermal dissipation through forced airflow or passive heatsinking</li>
      <li>High current through thin wires (like 28 AWG) can exceed safe current density limits (~1.5 A), risking insulation failure</li>
      <li>Use of enameled wire and firm winding tension ensures geometric consistency and field uniformity</li>
      <li>A non-conductive core (e.g., plastic pen barrel) ensures field isolation and prevents eddy current losses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These considerations become critical in embedded coil systems, high-speed switching applications, and RF magnetics.</p>

    <h3>Python Simulation Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of turns: 100</li>
      <li>Radius: 0.5 cm</li>
      <li>Length: 10 cm</li>
      <li>Current: 1 A</li>
      <li>Grid resolution: 0.5 cm in axial and radial directions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Field Profile Results</h3>
    <p>The simulation produced a strong, near-uniform axial field within the solenoid and a circular decay pattern outside. Key observations included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Central region:</strong> Axial field (Bz) nearly constant at ~63 μT, closely matching the theoretical μ₀nI prediction for an ideal solenoid</li>
      <li><strong>Edge fringing:</strong> At the coil’s ends, the field curves outward, showing the breakdown of uniformity as predicted by boundary conditions</li>
      <li><strong>Radial field:</strong> Inside the coil, Bx is negligible compared to Bz, while outside, Bx grows significantly due to curvature and field leakage</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Theoretical Insight:</strong> The axial uniformity stems from the symmetry and constructive overlap of fields from many turns. At the ends, fewer turns contribute, and the symmetry breaks—hence the curvature. Computationally, the finite integration of each turn’s contribution via Biot–Savart explains the smooth transition between core and edge regions.</p>

<h3>Conclusion from Simulation</h3>
<p>This simulation reinforced analytical methods and provided a tangible grasp of solenoid field structure. By visualizing the gradual emergence of uniformity within the coil and the inevitable edge effects, it offered not only empirical confirmation of textbook predictions but also nuanced understanding of where idealizations fail. The vector field visualization captured the invisible—but physically real—continuity of field lines, while the heatmap quantified the theoretical μ₀nI result with remarkable accuracy.</p>
<p>Computationally, the challenge lay in summing many weak field contributions from each segment—a direct analogue to real-world engineering systems where interactions are distributed and non-local. The necessity of discretizing the wire, integrating over the geometry, and interpreting the superposition principle in code form serves as a microcosm of physical modeling in electromagnetism. In practice, this means understanding not just what equations say, but how their limitations manifest numerically and how closely engineering models can approach them.</p>
<p>Altogether, this exercise was more than a simulation—it was a reflection on the synergy between analytical physics, numerical methods, and the constraints of physical reality. It deepened my intuition for vector fields, affirmed the predictive power of Maxwellian reasoning, and prepared me for more dynamic phenomena in the coming weeks.</p>
