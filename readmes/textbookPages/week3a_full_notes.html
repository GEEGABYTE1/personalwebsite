    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This week extends the study of magnetostatics into time-varying systems. We explore how changing magnetic fields induce voltages, leading to the concepts of self-inductance and mutual inductance. These phenomena form the core of transformer theory, switching power converters, motor drive systems, and electromagnetic sensing circuits.</p>

    <h2>Topics Covered</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Faraday’s Law of Induction</li>
      <li>Induced EMF in coils and loops</li>
      <li>Self-Inductance: \( V = L \frac{dI}{dt} \)</li>
      <li>Mutual Inductance and coupling coefficient</li>
      <li>Energy stored in inductors</li>
      <li>RL Transients and exponential decay</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. Faraday’s Law of Induction</h2>
    <p>Faraday’s Law describes how a changing magnetic flux induces an electromotive force (EMF):</p>
    <pre>EMF = - dΦ/dt</pre>
    <p>Where Φ is the magnetic flux through a loop: \( Φ = \int B \cdot dA \). The negative sign indicates Lenz’s Law—induced currents oppose the change in flux. This law is the foundation of power generation, inductors, and transformers.</p>

    <h2>2. Self-Inductance</h2>
    <p>In a coil carrying a changing current, the induced EMF opposes the change in current:</p>
    <pre>V_L = L (dI/dt)</pre>
    <p>Where L is the inductance in henries (H). Inductance is a measure of how much voltage is induced per rate of change of current. For a solenoid of length l and cross-sectional area A:</p>
    <pre>L = μ₀ n² A l</pre>
    <p>This shows that longer coils with more turns and larger area have greater inductance.</p>

    <h2>3. Energy Stored in an Inductor</h2>
    <p>Like capacitors store energy in electric fields, inductors store energy in magnetic fields:</p>
    <pre>U = (1/2) L I²</pre>
    <p>This expression is crucial in understanding transient behavior, magnetic energy storage, and how inductors buffer current changes in power electronics.</p>

    <h2>4. RL Circuit Transient Response</h2>
    <p>When a voltage is applied to a resistor and inductor in series, the current does not rise instantly. Instead, it follows:</p>
    <pre>I(t) = (V/R)(1 - e^{-t/τ})</pre>
    <p>Where τ = L/R is the time constant. A large inductance or small resistance means a slower response. This exponential ramp-up reflects the opposition to rapid current change.</p>

    <h2>5. Experimental Demonstration</h2>
    <p>Constructed an RL circuit using:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 H commercial inductor</li>
      <li>220 Ω resistor</li>
      <li>5 V DC source</li>
      <li>Oscilloscope across inductor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Measured voltage spikes at the moment of switch-on, and observed the decay across the inductor as it reached steady-state. Curve matched theoretical predictions with τ = 4.55 ms. Also captured back-EMF spike on switch-off, validating Lenz’s Law.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Python Simulation </h2>
    <pre><code>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

R = 220  # Ohms
L = 1.0  # Henrys
V = 5.0  # Volts
t = np.linspace(0, 0.03, 500)
i = (V/R)*(1 - np.exp(-t*R/L))

plt.plot(t*1000, i*1000)
plt.title("Current Rise in RL Circuit")
plt.xlabel("Time [ms]")
plt.ylabel("Current [mA]")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()</code></pre>
    <p>This simulates the time-domain behavior of the RL circuit used in the experiment, matching oscilloscope results.</p>

    <h3>Time Constant and Current Saturation</h3>
    <p>The exponential shape of the current curve is governed by the RL time constant, defined as:</p>
    <pre>τ = L / R</pre>
    <p>In our example, τ = 1 H / 220 Ω ≈ 4.55 ms. This means that after 4.55 milliseconds, the current has reached approximately 63% of its final steady-state value. The curve continues to asymptotically approach the maximum current of \( I_{\infty} = V/R = 22.7 \text{ mA} \), but never reaches it instantly.</p>

    <p>This saturation effect is a hallmark of inductive systems: they oppose changes in current flow. The steeper the initial voltage or the smaller the resistance, the faster the current climbs. However, this rate is always limited by the inductor’s physical characteristics and the governing differential equation. In real-world systems, understanding the time constant allows engineers to tune filter response times, control motor acceleration profiles, or prevent inrush currents from damaging sensitive components.</p>

    <p>The simulated plot confirms both the theoretical time constant and the physical limit imposed by circuit parameters, providing a practical visualization of transient electromagnetic behavior.</p>
    <h2>Load Line and Q-Point Analysis</h2>
    <p>The load line represents all possible combinations of plate current and plate voltage for a given plate supply voltage \(V_{PP}\) and load resistance \(R_L\). It is a straight line defined by:</p>
    <pre>V_p = V_{PP} - I_p * R_L</pre>
    <p>In this plot, if we assume a 100 kΩ load resistor and a 250 V plate supply, the load line can be overlaid on the triode characteristic curves. The point where this load line intersects a given plate curve (based on a chosen grid voltage) defines the Q-point—the operating point for linear amplification.</p>

    <p>The Q-point should ideally lie within the linear region of the chosen plate curve. If it's too close to cutoff (low current, high voltage) or saturation (high current, low voltage), distortion occurs as the signal clips. Proper biasing of the grid voltage ensures that the signal swings symmetrically around the Q-point without entering these nonlinear regions.</p>

    <p>Practically, this means choosing a grid voltage (e.g., -1.5V) such that the resulting intersection provides enough headroom on both sides for undistorted signal amplification. In analog design, this concept directly translates to transistor biasing strategies in BJTs and FETs, where load lines and Q-points ensure signal fidelity.</p>

    <h2>7. Reflection</h2>
    <p>Unlike DC circuits where responses are instantaneous, inductive systems reveal the inertia of current flow. This week taught me how magnetic fields resist abrupt changes and how energy is transferred dynamically through time-dependent interactions. Faraday’s Law, while simple in form, unlocks every transformer, motor, and wireless charging pad we use daily. Understanding these interactions both mathematically and physically provides deep intuition I’ll carry forward into switched-mode power supply design and electromagnetic actuator control.</p>
