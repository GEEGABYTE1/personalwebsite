    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This week begins the exploration of amplification, starting with its origin in vacuum tube triodes. We examine how these devices control large currents using small voltages and how this principle laid the foundation for all analog and digital electronics. From audio preamps to radar modulators, vacuum tubes were the first step in active signal manipulation.</p>

    <h2>Topics Covered</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Thermionic emission and electron flow in vacuum</li>
      <li>Structure and operation of diode and triode vacuum tubes</li>
      <li>Plate characteristics and transfer curves</li>
      <li>Common cathode amplifier configuration</li>
      <li>Load lines and operating point (Q-point)</li>
      <li>Input-output signal relationships and gain</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. Thermionic Emission and Triode Structure</h2>
    <p>In a vacuum tube, heating the cathode releases electrons via thermionic emission. These electrons are attracted to the positively biased anode (plate). The triode adds a control grid between them, which modulates the electron flow based on the input voltage.</p>
    <p>Small changes in grid voltage (V<sub>g</sub>) control large changes in plate current (I<sub>p</sub>), enabling amplification.</p>

    <h2>2. Plate Characteristics and Load Lines</h2>
    <p>The relationship between plate current and plate voltage for different grid voltages forms a family of curves. These are known as plate characteristics. When an external load resistor is added, the load line represents all combinations of V<sub>p</sub> and I<sub>p</sub> that satisfy Ohm’s Law:</p>
    <pre>V_p = V_PP - I_p * R_L</pre>
    <p>The intersection of a load line with a plate curve defines the operating point (Q-point).</p>

    <h2>3. Amplification and Gain</h2>
    <p>In the linear region, a small signal input (AC variation in V<sub>g</sub>) causes a proportional swing in plate current. This swing develops across the load resistor, producing a voltage output:</p>
    <pre>V_out = -g_m * R_L * v_in</pre>
    <p>Where g<sub>m</sub> is the transconductance of the tube. The gain is negative (inverting) and depends on R<sub>L</sub> and the tube’s g<sub>m</sub>.</p>

    <h2>4. Python Simulation</h2>
    <pre><code>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Vg = np.linspace(-3, 0, 6)  # Grid voltages
Vp = np.linspace(0, 300, 300)  # Plate voltages
mu = 100  # Amplification factor
rp = 30e3  # Plate resistance
Ip_curves = [(Vp / (rp + 1)) * (1 + vg / mu)**1.5 for vg in Vg]

for i, Ip in enumerate(Ip_curves):
    plt.plot(Vp, Ip, label=f"Vg = {Vg[i]:.1f}V")

plt.title("Simulated Triode Plate Characteristics")
plt.xlabel("Plate Voltage [V]")
plt.ylabel("Plate Current [mA]")
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.show()</code></pre>

    </figure>
    <p>This plot models how plate current varies with plate voltage under different control grid voltages, illustrating triode behavior.</p>

    <h2>5. Reflection</h2>
    <p>Understanding vacuum tubes helps demystify modern transistor behavior by tracing its conceptual origin. The principles of grid control, load line intersection, and small-signal linearization appear again in MOSFET and BJT circuits. This retro technology grounds my intuition for gain, biasing, and nonlinearity. Even as I design with op-amps and CMOS, I now see how it all started—with hot filaments, vacuum envelopes, and the birth of signal control.</p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>In the next section, we'll implement a simulated triode amplifier circuit and compare its linear region performance with early transistor stages. This will build the intuition necessary to bridge into transistor biasing and small-signal modeling in Week 4.</p>
